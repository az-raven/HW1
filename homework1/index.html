			<h3><abbr title="Virtual Reality Development">VRD</abbr> 264 • Spring 2025</h3>
			<p>
				While taking <abbr title="Virtual Reality Development">VRD</abbr> 264 at Cochise College, I created a
				number of advanced and interconnecting systems, including:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					a completely bespoke set of vehicle physics,
				</li>
				<li>
					a realistic firearms system complete with weapon jamming & accurate holographic sight parallax,
				</li>
				<li>
					a physically-based construction system using a saw & nailgun,
				</li>
				<li>
					a bespoke humanoid and vehicle navigation system,
				</li>
				<li>
					a physics-based helicopter complete with accurate controls & a
					<abbr title="Proportional, Integral, and Derivative controller">PID</abbr>-based pitch / yaw / roll /
					collective automation system,
				</li>
				<li>
					and a buoyancy system allowing the helicopter to land on the helipad of a ship.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><abbr title="Virtual Reality Development">VRD</abbr> 144 • Fall 2024</h3>
			<p>
				During my time in <abbr title="Virtual Reality Development">VRD</abbr> 144 at Cochise College, I created a fully
				physics-based player rig for <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> games. The rig integrated physically-based
				climbing, grabbing, and movement, creating emergent and intuitive game mechanics from simple behavior.
				These mechanics included functional ice climbing using ice axes, sliding down a zipline with a crowbar,
				and climbing a radio broadcast tower in <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>.

			<h3>Compensation Social • 2021 - 2023</h3>
			<p>
				Compensation Social was a live-service multiplayer <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> game I developed
				for the Meta Quest series of headsets as well as tethered <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>. I worked
				alongside a small team of developers as the lead backend developer and head artist. I developed and maintained
				the backend system the game used to manage player data over the course of the game's 3-year lifecycle. I also
				developed the <abbr title="User-Generated Content">UGC</abbr> creation tools of the game, which were -at the time-
				entirely unmatched on standalone <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>. At its peak, Compensation amassed over
				200 registered users.
